# Atlan Frontend Intern Hiring Challenge

## Steps taken to improve page load:

- Using formats like webp for smaller size of images (although, I have used very few images at the moment)

- Used TailwindCSS with PurgeCSS which helped cut down on unecessary CSS from reaching production

- Static site build which is generally faster
